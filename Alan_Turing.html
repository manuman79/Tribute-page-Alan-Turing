    <ul>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1912.-</span> Alan Mathison Turing born in Maida Vale, London, to Ethel Sara Turing (nee Stoney) and Julius Mathison Turing.</li>
        <li><span class=hyperlink-color>1918. -</span> Alan joins St Michael's day school in Hastings, where he does not do very well. He is sent to Hazelhurst Preparatory School when he is ten where he does much better and learns to play chess.</li>
        <li><span class=hyperlink-color>1926.- </span> Alan becomes a pupil at Sherborne School in Dorset. Alan is not interested in their traditional classical education as he really wants to spend his time doing Science and Mathematics</li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1928-1930. -</span>	 Alan enters 6th form at Sherborne and becomes great friends with Christopher Morcom, another talented boy who loves Maths and Science. While they are applying for university, Christopher suddenly dies. Alan is devastated. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1931-1934. -</span>	Alan becomes an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge to study Mathematics. He enjoys university and is highly successful. He graduates with distinction. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1935. -</span> Alan's work is so distinguished that he is elected Fellow of King's College, aged only 23. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1938. -</span> Alan goes to Princeton University in America to study mathematics and is awarded a PhD. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1939. -</span> Alan is asked to join the Government Codes and Ciphers School and arrives at Bletchley Park the day after war is declared. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1939-1940. -</span> 	With Gordon Welchman, Alan develops the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by the Germans using their Enigma machine. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1940-1942. -</span>	During 1942, Alan and his colleagues also manage to break the more complicated German Naval Enigma system. This is a tremendous help to the Allies in the Battle of the Atlantic. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1943-1945. -</span>	Alan is asked to work as a top level intelligence link with USA, which he visits to share information on cryptology (code-breaking). </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1945. -</span> At the end of the war, Alan Turing is awarded the OBE for his wartime services. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1946. -</span> Alan joins the National Physical Laboratory, in Teddington and he publishes a paper with the first detailed design of a stored-program computer. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1948. -</span> Alan is appointed as as Reader in the Mathematics Department of Manchester University. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1949. -</span>	Alan is made deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at Manchester University. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1950. -</span>	Alan publishes'Computing Machinery and Intelligence' in which he develops the Turing Test, an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called intelligent. The paper will become very famous. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1951. -</span>	During his year, Alan is elected Fellow of the Royal Society FRS and also gives a talk about Artificial Intelligence on the BBC radio's Third Programme. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1952. -</span> Alan is arrested for gross indecency and loses his security clearance. He is offered chemical treatment as an alternative to imprisonment. The hormone treatment has a very detrimental effect on him. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1954. -</span>	June 8th - Alan's body is found in his home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. The post-mortem finds that his death had been caused by poisoning. A half-eaten apple is found next to him laced with cyanide. His body is cremated at Woking crematorium. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1966. -</span> The annual Turing Award is established and given each year to a person for technical contributions to the computing community. It is generally viewed as important as the Nobel Prize. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1986. -</span> The play, Breaking the Code by Hugh Whitemore opens in the West End and then transfers to Broadway. The part of Alan Turing is played by Derek Jacobi who is nominated for three Tony Awards. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>1988. -</span> A Blue Plaque is unveiled at Turing's birthplace in Warrington Crescent, London (now the Colonnade Hotel). </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>2001. -</span>	A statue of Alan Turing is unveiled in Sackville Gardens, Manchester. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>2004. -</span> A memorial plaque is unveiled at his last home in Wilmslow, Cheshire. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>2007. -</span>	A slate sculpture of Alan Turing is unveiled at Bletchley Park. </li>
        <li> <span class=hyperlink-color>2009. -</span>	In response to a petition signed by thousands of people, The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown issues a public apology in which he describes the treatment of Alan Turing as "appalling". </li>
